As Distributed System should handle Fault Tolerance and it should be highly available, the
project is to make Distributed Library Management System (DLMS) in such a way that
new DLMS tolerate single software (non-malicious Byzantine) failure and highly available
under a single process crash failure using active replication. The system must consist of
three different Replicas implementation as well as three new modules Front End, Sequencer
and Replica Manager in order to achieve this functionality.

The different part is handled by different people:
Failure-free sequencer: Divyansh Thakar
Front-end: Mostafa Marandi
Replica manager: Yi Zhang
